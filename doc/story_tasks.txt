Story: Image w/ CIE + HSB populated on demand
 
    summary: Image extension w/ cieXY and HSB populated on demand
      created and replacing color use in SkylineExtractor.

    time estimate: 
        minimum: < 1 day
        maximum: < 1.5 days

    amount of time used:

    state of completion:

    comments regarding state:

    comments:
        result is the source code and tests.  UML should not be
        necessary for this story.
        coverage reports should be updated exterior to this at
        some point in the near future along w/ other QA metrics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1:
    goal: create and test the data structure.

    details:  ImageWithCIE should be refactored to include HSB and
              to include a flag of whether a pixel's extra color
              has been populated.  The cieXY, and HSB data should be
              calculated on demand when they don't exist.

              (For class, choosing inheritance over composition for 
              the additional fields that Image.java needs.)
              Call the new class ImageExt.

              Would be nice to have a convenience method to populate
              the 8 neighborhood or 24 neighborhood area too.

              Tests should cover retrieving color information accurately.

   time estimate: minimum 1 hour, maximum half day
  
   amount of time used: 3 hours

   state of completion: complete

Task 2:
    goal: ImageIOHelper needs to return an ImageExt object

    details:  ImageExt should be the loaded image in SkylineExtractor
              so ImageIOHelper needs methods to create one.

              tests should be similar to the other ImageIOHelper tests
              for Image

   time estimate: minimum half hour, maximum 2 hours
  
   amount of time used:  < half hour

   state of completion: completed

Task 3:
    goal: replace use of image pixel color in SkylineExtractor w/
          ImageExt

    details:  ImageExt should be the loaded image in SkylineExtractor
              and should be replacing all use of color within that class.

              tests should be that similar results are obtained as
              currently by same tests.
              this will be improved in the near future, but for now,
              just need to assert same current results which are
              admittedly, not yet robust testing. 

   time estimate: minimum half day, maximum 1 day
