Story: Near optimization of SkylineExtractor's findClouds method.
 
    summary: findClouds needs to be changed to make it possible to
      find the best fitting or nearly best fitting combinations
      of color and contrast clauses.  The clauses are the conditional
      logic to learn whether a pixel is sky or not and hence added
      to the sky points (or not) in a BFS visitor pattern.
      
      findClouds is currently given a set of seed sky points
      and the original color image and gradient images from which
      it applies various color and contrast clauses to grow the
      seed sky points until they reach the skyline or close to the
      skyline.  
      findClouds needs to be refactored to also accept as arguments,
      the clauses and coefficients for the clauses.
      The SkylineExtractor may need additional changes to make sure
      that member variables don't change state upon running findClouds
      so it can be re-used with the same images and a fresh set of
      sky points, clauses, and clause coefficients.

      A fitness function is needed to estimate how close the result
      is to the expected result.
         This involves defining the skyline and sky points accurately
      for the tests.  The penalty for overrunning the skyline boundary
      should be very large.

      An algorithm is needed to use the fitness function to determine
      the next set of improved coefficients to be tried w/ findClouds.
      Because there are so many parameters, a gradient approach is 
      less appealing than a heuristic approach such as the 
      Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method, so will use that.

      A harness that accepts image files and runs the findClouds
      method over all of the possible combinations of clauses,
      called equations and uses the downhill simplex method to
      find the nearly best fitting or best fitting coefficients
      for each equation and test image is needed.

      A pattern of determining the best fitting coefficients 
      among each equation and test is needed within the harness.

      A means of making the expected results for the test images is
      needed.

    possible complications: 
       unknown existing bugs found in the process that may need to
          be fixed (usually not a problem, but have delayed better
          testing habits while exploring how to implement most of 
          this and related code.)
       some test images not yet included will require a change in 
          the methods preceding the use of findClouds to find the
          sky seed points.  those images are not included and the
          method doesn't exist yet, but the images could be included
          with guesstimated seed sky points given to findClouds 
          (but this would not be a robust long term solution).

Task 1:
    goal: Create the expected sky-only images from the test images to
          compare the results with.

    details:  
          This could be done by starting with the thresholding part of
          the SkylineExtractor algorithm and then correcting for binning
          and manually extracting the skyline to make a mask using a 
          tool like Gimp.

          requires making a class in tests directory to use the needed
          part of SkylineExtractor and read in and write images.

          Also needs a run target in the build script to run the class,
          but not as a regular part of tests.

   time estimate:

Task 2:
    goal: Explore the parameters to be fit to identify the border.
          Use LDA to find the best separability and to see if there
          is a multiplicative relationship between variables.

   details:  
          For the skyline, making 2 sets of data points: those
          about 3 pixels above the skyline and those 1 pixel below
          in order to look at the contrast and color of
          the sky versus non-sky pixels.
          Note that the test image do not have images with sky at
          the bottom and foreground on the top of the image, so using
          the general y-3 and y+1 is fine.

          Parameters that appear to be the strongest changing at the
          skyline are contrast, hue and blue or red depending on
          whether the sky is blue or red.

          The properties to explore are constructed similarly to how 
          they are constructed during the growing of pixels in findClouds.
          For a sky pixel in which a neighbor is being tested for
          contrast and color which indicates that it is also sky
          or is a border skyline pixel, the property tested for 
          contrast is 
          ((average contrast of its neighbor sky pixels) 
              - (contrast of candidate pixel)) /
              (standard deviation of contrast in the neighbor sky pixels)
          where neighbors is defined as the surrounding 8 sky pixels or 
          surrounding 24.

   comments:
       can clearly see separation for red skies using contrast and hue
       though using contrast and red would be nearly as good.
       can clearly see separation for blue skies using contrast and hue
       though using contrast and blue would be nearly as good.
       both methods require the condition that contrast and color diff
       be larger than the standard deviations in order to be a candidate
       border pixel.
              
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3:
    goal: design the passing and use of the clause coefficients and 
          clauses.

    details:  
       findClouds needs to accept as arguments the coefficients of
       clauses and the clauses. 
       A complete clause fitting all needed is:
           ((param1/param2)  LTorGT coeff)  where param2 can be a '1'

       It also needs a way of knowing that param1 is color_point - color_sky,
       for example.  the parameter number and the intended parameters
       will be hard wired into the method and documented.

       The logic needed should be possible as ANDs of the clauses, but
       there may be an OR needed for blue and red skies.  
[paused writing here...]

       since blue vs red skies is the only conditional logic, may need
       to separate the red and blue sky tests because trying to improve 
       parameters in the downhill simplex would not be correct if the
       parameters don't affect the solution.

       initial look at parameters did not show any other 'OR' logic.

       note that this isn't a constraint satisfaction problem because 
       the coefficients need to be determined and refined.

          and coefficients.

    details:

          and coefficients.

          write a simple test for the new method.
