These are notes for making 3D point clouds from stereo images
summarized from browsing papers in the literature and reviews
and tutorials.
   Rectification is outlined briefly, then the making of disparity maps,
   followed by the visualization of the 3-D point clouds.
========================================================================

--------------
Rectification:
--------------
Once a set of point correspondances between images have been derived,
and the stereo projection transformation solved from those, the 
transformation parameters are used to create rectified left and right 
images where the epipolar lines are parallel to the horizontal axis.

   There are 3 algorithms for rectification:
      -- planar (Fusiello et al. 2000;  Trucco and Verri 1998):
      -- cylindrical rectification (Oram 2001):
      -- polar rectification (Pollefeys et al. 1999):

   If the transformation matrix is still normalized, one can use the
   extrinsic parameters rotation and translation:
      (reference for this section? adding more details and cleaning up this section soon...)
      -- rotate the left image plane so that the epipole goes to
         infinity along the horiz line.
         Since the rotation transformation is an orthonormal matrix,
         have to derive the other two vectors.  The starting vector
         is found by the epipole which is a forehortened vector of the
         translation "t" between 2 camera coordinates.
         So let the first vector be "t"/|"t"|
             then the other 2 vectors are found as R_rect^T = [u, u_perp, u x u_perp].
         Set the rotation matrices to 
             R_left = R_rect and
             R_right = R*R_rect for the left and right cameras.
         then points in the rectified system, q, are
             q_left = (f/z_left)*R_left*p_left
             q_right = (f/z_right)*R_right*p_right
                 where p_left = (x_left, y_left, z_left)^T
                 and p_right = (x_right, y_right, z_right)^T
      -- after the transformation, the image needs to be resampled and interpolated
         to compensate for irregular empty pixels.
         (Kang and Ho 2011; Loop and Zhang 1999; Miraldo and Araujo 2013;
         OpenCV 2013; Xhang 2000).

  
-------------------------
Making of Disparity Maps:
-------------------------

Given rectified stereo images, one can learn the relative distance of
objects in the left or right image within distance limits dependening 
on camera details.

When viewing a 3D point through 2 cameras, if the cameras are not
pointing towards one another, a point in the image of the camera on the right
will be lower horizontally than the image of the point in the left camera.
This disparity is also inversely proportional to the depth of the point.

stereo vision of the rectified images:

                                   #P(x,y,z)
                                 . | .
                               .   |   .
                             .     |     .
                           .       |       .
               <-x_L->   .         |         .  <-x_R->
  image plane |-------# P_L        |       P_R #-------| image plane
                   .               |              .    .
                .                  |                 . f=focal length
              @----------------------------------------@
          opt center          b=Baseline           opt center
            left                                     right
            camera                                   camera

    For each camera, left and right, the focal length f is the perpendicular
    distance from the optical center to the image plane,

    b is the distance between the right and left cameras.

    P is a point in the (x, y, z) reference frame seen as P_L and P_R in the left
    and right images, respectively.
    x_L and x_R are the x coordinates of P_L and P_R.
    Using geometry (similar triangles and parallax), and camera details, one can 
    derive the depth of the point P and know that value relative to the
    camera.  d is that distance for P and is called the disparity for that point.
    
    If the cameras are pinhole cameras, can use similar triangles to
    write
              b * f       b * f
       z = ----------- = -------
            x_L - x_R       d

    Note that the camera should be calibrated so that the objects of interest are
    within a range of distance from the focal plane.
    -- To calibrate the camera:
       one needs the intrinsic parameters of each camera such as pixel size, 
       focal length, and lens distortions
       and the camera extrinsics (rotation, translation etc of each image).
(add a good reference here)

       Calibration requires multiple pairs of images of a test pattern viewed 
       from different angles.  Need the entire pattern visible in each image 
       without occlusion.   A chess or checker board pattern is common as rulers
       projected to 2 dimensions.

       The test pattern should be at approx the distance of the objects of interest
       to photograph after calibration.   The measurements of the the test pattern,
       such as a checkerboard, should be measured very precisely.

    -- The distance in pixels between corresponding points in the rectified images
       is called disparity. The disparity is used for 3-D reconstruction, because
       it is proportional to the distance between the cameras and the 3-D world point.
       That is, objects w/ larger disparity are closer to the camera.

       from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~hema/rgbd-workshop-2014/papers/Alhwarin.pdf

    There are many algorithms for determining sparse or dense disparity maps.
    Here, will summarize the simplest of methods, the fastest, and then the most 
    accurate but slower algorithms.

    -- The SIMPLEST algorithm for making a disparity map would be to compare patches
       of a block size in the left image to patches in the right image using a brute force
       comparison of each pixel centered patch in the left image and a range search against
       each pixel centered patch in the right image.
          -- One can improve upon that by retaining the pixel centered patch calculations
             from the right image and reusing them for each left patch comparison.
          -- One can improve upon that by limiting the comparisons to only those 
             in the forward scan directions once one establishes the first best 
             matching patches.
          -- One can limit the number of rows needed in a comparison presumably in a few ways
             including possibly during camera system set up.
          -- One could improve upon that by storing the previous left pixel patch calculations
             by columns and rows in a manner to update the patch of comparison
             (more memoization)
          -- One could imagine re-using the points of correspondences used to derive the 
             transformations in the first place as anchors of smaller error disparities
             that be used to define boundaries from which one could further match left and right within
             the bounds.  Note, one of the fastest current algorithms further written about in the next
             section, uses different points in such a manner to create a Delanauy Triangulation of 
             bounds to search within to populate the remaining disparity map points.

          The patch block comparisons tend to use a greyscale intensity for the pixel (0-255)
          or color space indexing such as CIE x and y. (The CIE xy color space are independent of
          intensity, but most objects have a color dependent reflection (see index of refraction 
          for materials or albedo for more information).  But if the illumination
          is largely grey scattering of light, that is Mie scattering, CIE xy could be very useful
          for segmentation of related pixels.)

          The 3 different patterns used for comparing the blocks of pixels are for the simplest:
              -- Sum of absolute differences:
                 \sum{\sum{ | L(r,c) - R(r,c-d) | }}
              -- Sum of squared differences:
                 \sum{\sum{ (L(r,c) - R(r,c-d))^2 }}
              -- Normalized correlation:
                 \sum{\sum{ L(r,c) dot R(r,c-d) }}
                 --------------------------------------------------------------
                 \sqrt{(\sum{\sum{ L(r,c)^2 }}) dot (\sum{\sum{ R(r,c-d)^2 }})} 
              
              where r and c are row and column of the  pixel within the left image (L)
              and right image (R).
              d is the disparity.

          The disparity for a pixel is then where those comparison functions are minimized
          and that means that the number of scanned pixels, that is the offset from left and
          right, has to be large enough to find the real disparity for a left pixel.

          Instead of using the minimum, one can interpolate between the smallest values 
          to find the peak of those as a parabola if only using a 1-D scan comparison:
            https://chrisjmccormick.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/stereo-vision-tutorial-part-i/
            d_estimated = d_2 - 0.5*(C_3 - C_1)/(C_1 - 2*C_2 + c_3) 
               where _2 is for the closest matching block and _1 and _3 are those to the left
               and right of it, respectively.

          Note also, that some algorithms use segmentation of either disparity or of color in
          the first step to interpret the disparities as surfaces.  Segmentation, combined
          with growing connected similar regions are sometimes used.

          Algorithms similar to the above tend to have the longest runtimes unless steps
          are taken to make the comparisons smaller in number and size.

    -- The FASTEST algorithms for making a disparity map want to be usable in realtime systems.
        The algorithm with the fastest runtime with a high accuracy seems to be:
            Geiger, Roser, and Urtasun 2010, "Efficient Large-Scale Stereo Matching"
            http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2010ACCV.pdf
            The authors offer the code under a GPL license, but only for non-commercial systems.
                http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=libelas.zip
            The algorithm uses a Delanay triangulation of well determined disparities called
            "support points" as boundary points to more efficiently search the disparity space.
            Image boundary "support points" are added with values assigned from their neighbors.
            It assumes the left and right images are already aligned vertically so that
            scaning is only needed along a row.
            They discard ambiguous matches if the 2nd best match is within a threshold 0.9 
            (factor?  difference?) of the first.  They discard matches which look spurious
            by being very different from all of their surrounding support points.
            For each pixel, the support points within a 20x20 region are used to calculate
            a mean which is used to limit the disparity range of the pixel search to less
            than 3 * sigma from the mean (where sigma is presumably the standard deviation
            of the mean).   For those pixels, feature vectors are created using Sobel operators
            in blocks of size 5x5.  the feature vectors are used to generate probabilities of
            matches between the compared left and right image pixels.
            Their generative model: (1) Given support points and left image pixels, draw
            a disparity from the prior probability function which is eqn 2 in the paper.  
            (2) Given the generated disparity and left pixel, draw the right pixel from the 
            constrained Laplacian distribution which uses the feature vectors.  This is eqn
            4 in the paper.  The "draws" are repeated 100 times for each pixel.
            For each left pixel set of generative disparities and right pixels, the estimated
            final disparity for that pixel is found by minimizing an eqn that combines use of
            the log of the prior and constrained laplacian probabilities.
            (Note: the 100 throws might be purely for the paper figure and the impl in code
            might be different?) 
            Note also that the minimization for each pixel's matching r sets of data can be
            completed faster on processors that can process SIMD instructions provided by
            the authors.

            Are there some images in which the calculated "support points" are not 
            a small enough mesh to handle image characteristics such as shadows?
            just noticing the disparity maps for this and SGM and a proposed local plane 
            sweep algorithm in other online slides...

        -- Note that in their paper, the next best performing for the runtime is from the paper
               "Growing Correspondence Seeds.  A Fast Stereo Matching of Large Images" by
               Jan Cech, 2007.
               Their code is offered w/o commercial restrictions, but is in matlab.

    -- Among the most ACCURATE algorithms considering a compromise w/ runtime are the Graph-Cut algorithms.
        One of the latest implementations:
            http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yuri/Papers/pami04.pdf
            "An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for
            Energy Minimization in Computer Vision"

            http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software/maxflow-v3.03.src.zip
        and before that was V. Kolmogorov and R. Zabih, 2001
            "Computing visual correspondence with occlusions using graph cuts."
            http://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html, match-v3.4.src.tar.gz

        Compare where possible to Semi-Global Matching.
           There is a CUDA only Semi-Global Matching algorithm: 
               "Real-time Stereo Vision: Optimizing Semi-Global Matching" by Michael et al. 2013.
               http://www.ini.rub.de/data/documents/michaeletal_improvesgm_iv2013.pdf
           There is Hirschmuller 2005
               but there are mentions of using it in textureless patches or where dense 
               disparity maps are needed.

    In navigation systems with very high resolution images, wouldn't an early 
         down sampled image pair solution much faster than 1 second be useful 
         before a more accurate dense disparty map that might take 10 seconds?
